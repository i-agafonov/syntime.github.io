                <h2 class="header">Why exactly Switzerland?</h2>
                <p>Switzerland is a country with high potential development of cryptocurrency in the financial market. Already in 2014 in Switzerland Bitcoin equated to foreign currency and is a means carry out commercial transactions. This summer came into force a decision on the establishment of SBEX. In this regard, all banks in Switzerland are now taking deposits in bitcoin, and the owner of cryptocurrency can get the money in Swiss francs at local ATMs. Switzerland is becoming one of the most favorable countries for Bitcoin. Because of the increased interest in Bitcoin in the financial market of Switzerland, cryptocurrency is beginning to become increasingly popular and is taking legitimacy.</p>
                <p>The Swiss Confederation is a country with the ancient traditions of the highest level in the field of financial and banking services. The largest and most ancient financial conglomerates and banks in Europe, such as, UBS, Schweizerische Nationalbank, Credit Suisse, Raiffeisen are here. These banks have proven their reliability and stability more than once, so the richest people of the all world have accounts in Swiss banks. The banking system is the developed, accurate and well coordinated "financial mechanism." Occurring every second transaction with the customer's bank account, a transfer of money from one account to another, the exchange of one currency for another, the discovery of new deposits and accounts, payment transactions with credit and other... All this is very laborious, spends a lot of time and energy. Currency SwissCoin created to simplify bank operations and working with clients. The single currency for the entire network of the Swiss banks will let quickly execute transactions and transfers. Bank operations with customer deposits will considerably simplified. Also throughout the network of payment terminals in Switzerland, and in the terminals Bitaccess will be the payment currency SwissCoin.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Security</h2>
                <p>We use reliable methods of encryption and security of our systems, such as PoS and PoW: X11. Combining the work of these two principles of protection we provide the reliability and serviceability in working with SwissCoin. Time-tested and other large projects crypto currency PoS and PoW: X11 earned the trust and secured their good reputation among the methods of encryption and security systems.</p>

                        <p>PoW: X11 (Proof - of - Work: X11) - One of the most popular methods of encryption in the world crypto currency. Received universal trust due to excellent job. The main objective of PoW: X11 is the principle of the protection systems against abuse services (for example, DoS-attacks or spamming).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="colon">
                        <p>PoS (Proof - of - Stake) - Use as an alternative to PoW, but this method of protection has its own unique method of data encryption, based on the need to prove a certain amount of storage funds in the account. Working together, PoW: X11 and PoS provide a high degree of protection of all data crypto currency SwissCoin and our customers.</p>

                <p>In SwissCoin we use the algorithm DarkGravityWave (DGW), which corrected some bugs, such as vulnerability to timewarp attacks. Also, this algorithm is more quick and sensitive to changes in the complexity of mining and more.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the good optimization of our program we were able to reduce the execution time of each blog up to 60 seconds. We think this is a good advantage of our currency.</p>
